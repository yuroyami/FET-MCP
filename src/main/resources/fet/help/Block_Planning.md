Mode: block-planning. This mode assigns activities with a subject and students to FET hours (real-life time slots, day and hour) and to FET days (real-life teachers). Be careful, the basic time and space constraints are much stronger, and each students set may have a single occupied column from all the columns of a row.

Instructions for the block-planning mode.

Last modified on 4 April 2025.

The block-planning mode was suggested, chronologically, by these users: Jude G, ChicagoPianoTuner, and Darren McDonald. You can follow a forum discussion about it here: https://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/forum/index.php?topic=4151.0

The main ideas:

- The user Jude G wanted to allocate the activities to teachers based on qualifications.

- The user Jude G and then ChicagoPianoTuner suggested this: the FET days are real-life teachers, and the FET hours are real-life time slots. Activities with common students cannot intersect in the real-life slots, so they cannot have overlapping FET hours. Similarly, if rooms are assigned, activities with common rooms also cannot have overlapping FET hours. Note that rooms can only be assigned if "teacher" activities are used (see the note about speeding up timetable generation below).

- The user ChicagoPianoTuner suggested these:

    FET days are real teachers.

    FET students are real students.

    FET subjects are real subjects. Subjects preferred starting day can be used to link real teachers (FET days) to subjects.

    Each activity has 1 student. It is placed on a FET day based on its subject.

    Constraint "set of activities occupies max time slots from selection" is used to make sure that activities all overlap to make a course. E.g. if 8 students want art (1 block, FET duration = 2), I can add all 8 art activities to the constraint and make max time slots = 2 (selecting only art teacher's FET day).

    Constraint "activity tags not overlapping" (each tag = the subject) ensures that activities with different subjects aren't placed at the same hour on the same FET day (real teacher).

    Constraint "activities max simultaneous from a set in selected time slots" can be used to make sure that no section of a subject has too many students enrolled. My notation: a "section" is an instance of a subject. So the subject is "physics" and if there are 40 students taking physics, that is too big for one group. So there must be two "sections" of that subject. They may be with the same teacher or different teachers - it depends on what is desired. If I want the maximum number of students to be 22, I can use "max simultaneous from a set in selected time slots".

- Liviu Lalescu suggested this:

    Constraint "a set of activities occupies max time slots from selection" can be used to ensure that a teacher doesn't have too many blocks of activities assigned.

    Constraint "max total activities from a set in selected time slots" can be used with an overflow/fake block (see below) to restrict the allowed number of activities that cannot be placed in a "real" block.

- Darren McDonald suggested this:

    Constraint "Break" under the Time tab can be used to mark blocks in which a teacher is unavailable.

- With ideas from ChicagoPianoTuner, Darren McDonald, and Liviu Lalescu:

    If not all the options of the students can be respected, add one or more overflow/fake block, at the end of the day, so that impossible activities get scheduled there. And constrain the maximum number of activities there with the new constraint designed especially for the block-planning mode, max total activities from a set in selected time slots. You could use a progressive approach, decreasing the maximum allowed total number of activities in the overflow/fake slot(s) until no solution is possible anymore.

- With ideas from ChicagoPianoTuner and Darren McDonald:

    While activity tags can be used with the constraint "activity tags not overlapping" to prevent a teacher who can teach more than one subject from having those subjects placed in the same block, this may also prevent impossible activities from being placed in the fake/overflow block. There are at least two ways to address this: adding fake teachers, or adding additional fake/overflow slots.

    As an example of the first approach, if you have 40 distinct courses, you could add extra teacher slots (FET days) so that there are 40 days. Then, adjust your "A set of activities has a set of preferred starting times" constraints (used to ensure activities are allocated to the correct teacher(s)) so that, for example, all S1 courses have to fall on day T1 in "real" blocks, or in the fake/overflow blocks of any other teacher.

    As an example of the second approach, one could add a number of fake blocks equal to the maximum number of unique courses taught by any teacher. For example, if one teacher has at most 3 distinct subjects they might teach, then 3 fake/overflow blocks could be used.

- The user Darren McDonald described the following use case:

I am planning to use a two-stage process: using the 'Block-planning' mode to plan blocks, then using the 'Official' mode to prepare a final timetable. A little bit more detail about my timetabling situation may help explain.

My school offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma programme (as do many international schools), which is a two year programme offered in the final two years of high school, and block timetabling is useful for this group. Students choose 6 subjects to study over two years, and will choose 3 HL (Higher Level) courses, and 3 SL (Standard Level) courses. (HL courses require more time each week, but this isn't important at this stage.) Enrollment in courses will not be very uniform: for example, we may have only 5 students taking Music SL, but 14 students taking Geography SL, and 50 students taking Mathematics SL, so, there's only need for one section (one standard FET activity) for both Music SL and Geography SL, but 3 sections (3 standard FET activities) for Mathematics SL (since our class sizes are capped at 17). In a standard FET timetable, each of these activities would have several subactivities (without going into the details, SL courses would have 5, HL courses 7, in a two-week timetable).

Now if Geography SL and Music SL have no students (or teachers) in common, they can occur at the same time, on the same day (say, at 9am on Monday) in the standard FET timetable. However, if they have no students in common, all of their subactivities can be timetabled together (Tuesday at 12pm, Wednesday at 11am, etc.), which then forms a block, a group of courses that run simultaneously in all of their instances. The question, then, is which other courses can added to that block? Well, one section of Mathematics SL could also join that block, but only if that section of Mathematics SL has no students in common with Geography SL and Music SL. Because we need to run multiple sections of several courses (Chemistry SL, Biology SL, Mathematics SL, etc.), the block timetabling question to be answered has two parts: which assignments of students to sections allows us to form blocks (subject/section groups) in which each student is able to take the courses they've selected, and what are the resulting blocks?

To answer that question, the block-planning mode can be used, using constraints as suggested by ChicagoPianoTuner. At my school we are using seven blocks, so in block-planning I need only 7 hours per day. Geography SL is a subject, with one activity for each student enrolled in the course. Similarly, Mathematics SL is a subject, with one activity for each student. At this stage, then, there is no need to take into account the number of times a course meets in a week, etc., so one activity per student per course is all that's required. A successfully generated block-planning mode timetable will allow me to identify which courses should go in Block A (block-planning mode FET Hour 1), Block B (block-planning FET Hour 2), etc., and which students should be allocated to each section. (This actually needs to be done only for Grade 11, since students in Grade 12 can keep the same blocks they had in the previous year.)

With that information, I could move to the official mode to generate the real timetable: Block A becomes an activity tag which could be used to ensure activities in the same block get the same actual time, and I know that students assigned to a section have no conflicts within the blocks.

- The user ChicagoPianoTuner described the following use case:

There are real 8 blocks (A-H).
Students in grades 9 and 10 take one course in each block (8 courses total).
Each student in grades 9-10 has 6 "mandatory" courses that must be scheduled in a real block with weight 100% - easy to implement, set of activities set preferred starting times, using a tag.
The remaining courses are listed in preference order. There are 4 preferences, ranked 1-4. It is desired that 2 of these fall in the real blocks. The other 2 may be considered 'reserve' choices and should hopefully fall in fake blocks.

Two approaches using block-planning to treat this case were suggested by ChicagoPianoTuner and Darren McDonald:

- If, say, you have 50 distinct courses and 40 teachers, you could add 10 fake teacher slots (FET days) so that there are 50 teacher slots (in general, max(number of courses, number of teachers) teacher slots would be required). Then, adjust your "A set of activities has a set of preferred starting times" constraints (used to make sure the right teachers get the right courses) so that, for example, all S1 courses have to fall on day T1 in Blocks A-H or in any of the F1-F4 time slots (on any day). Then all the unsatisfiable preference 1 choices could be distributed along that F1 "row" without overlapping tags.

- One could also add a number of "fake" hours equal to the number of choices (4 in this case) times the max number of unique courses taught by any teacher (3 in this toy example), so instead of 4 fake blocks, I have 12: F1_a, F1_b, F1_c, F2_a,... , F4_c. Then "first choice" could happen in F1_a, F1_b, or F1_c, and "second choice" in F2_a, etc.

- The users Volker Dirr and ChicagoPianoTuner suggested that the following method may help improve the speed of timetable generation:

In addition to having one activity per student choice, create one activity per teacher-section. E.g. if teacher T1 teaches subject S1, S2, S2, S2, and S3 (five hours, three unique subjects), create five activities, no FET students, FET teacher = real teacher, tag = "teacher_activity" or something like that, FET subject = [S1, S2, S2, S2, S3]. Use activities occupy max slots from selection to link each of these activities to student selections, e.g. if 15 students selected S1, then activities occupy max slots would contain those 15 activities, + 1 teacher activity, number of slots = 1, selected slots = real hours of FET day corresponding to real teacher. For S2, if 50 students requested that course, you would do 50 + 3 teacher activities, number of slots = 3, selected slots = real hours of FET day corresponding to real teacher.

In my use case, I generated a timetable with a conflict score of 80 in about 40 minutes. Then I locked all activities with tag = "teacher_activity," and then generated again. Doing this brought my conflicts from 80 down to 38, and the second generation took ~15 seconds.

Further instructions by ChicagoPianoTuner, regarding tricks to make a two semester timetable: If your students have some different courses in semester 1 and semester 2, there are a few things you need to do. First, double the number of hours in your FET day, creating an hour for each block in semester 1, and another for semester 2, including fakes. The structure should be A_sem1, B_sem1, ..., FAKE_1_sem1, ... A_sem2, B_sem2, FAKE_1_sem2, ... FAKE_N_sem2. Now, for subjects that only last one semester, you can create one activity per student choice, as you did before. If you care which semester it's in, use a set of activities has a set of preferred starting times and select the hours corresponding to the specific semester.

For subjects that last the entire year (both semesters), you need to create two activities for each student choice and corresponding teacher activity. They should already be constrained to occur on specific FET days corresponding to real teachers. If there are multiple teachers for the same subject, you need to add a constraint to each student activity must occur on the same day to ensure the students have the same teacher for semester 1 as semester 2. If you want those activities to occur in the same block in semester 1 as semester 2 (which you probably do to avoid confusion, but it is not strictly necessary in some cases), add two constraints for each pair of activities: "min gaps (hours) between a set of activities," and "max gaps (hours) between a set of activities". The number of hours, N, should be the same for both constraints. N should be equal to the number of real blocks + number of fake blocks - 1, assuming the courses have duration 1 (each activity occupies exactly one block). If your courses occupy more than one block, decrease the value of N by 1 for each course duration. The constraint "max gaps (hours) between a set of activities" was designed/introduced in the block-planning mode.

If you would like to keep the same sections in two groups of activities, you could use the constraint of type 'Two sets of activities have the same sections', introduced on 2 April 2025, suggested by Edward Downes and Richard B. Gross. See its dialog for Help about it.
